module wrapper function in nodejs

In NodeJS, require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. 
require() statement basically reads a JS file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object..


module.exports and require coming from where?

() grouping operator


(function(){

}) anonymous function
this is called module wrapper function.
when we run code then nodejs add our code to module wrapper function.
and due to module wrapper function, our variables and functions will become private.

parameters of module wrapper function i.e, exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname have local scope for 
every individual file or module or code.



(function(){

})(); parenthesis at last of module wrapper function or IIFE is because of automatic running of that function.
use () operator to call this anonymous function immediately after completion of its definition

in js, our function not dependent on other. and called automatically after page refresh and all the data inside it is private
and works only inside it. it is called iife..

we dont need to define module wrapper function and dont need to code inside it. it will be done by node. if we do so, then
we can get errors while using .


and __dirname and __filename is needed to know about file and dir name and we can use it normally in our file without module
wrapper fun

index.js -> console.log(__dirname) and console.log(__filename)
